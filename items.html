        <h2>The First level of the Cabin</h2>
    <p2> This particular Davy Crockett Cabin, made using the original wood, is decorated with scenic attire, and life-like props that have been used during Davy Crockett's life. 
        The interior is adorned by: bear skins, well-worn beds, taxadermied animal skins, and old firearms mounted on the walls and in display cases.     
        </p2>
        <h2>The Second level of the Cabin</h2>
        <p3>
         On the second floor of Davy's Crockett, there is a large weaving station that Davy Crockett's wife weaved clothing, balankets, as well as small pounches and other small items.  
           On the other side of the weaving station there is a bed where Davy Crockett slept while he was alive.
        </p3>
        <h2>The Perimeter of the Cabin</h2>
        <p5>
        Once you apporach the cabin you are greeted by a tiny, open area of land that is filled with grass and picnic tables and surrounded by fencing. 
          Off to the left side of the cabin there is a tombstone, representing the memory of Crockett's mother.
          To the right is a small bridge that crosses over a large gap into a large open area with more picnic tables.
