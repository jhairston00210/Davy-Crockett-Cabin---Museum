      <p1>The original cabin was built in 1822, and remained Davy Crockett's home until 1835 when he died at the Alamo. The cabin was moved and made into a museum in the late 1980's. As of now, the cabin has been partially remodeled, with only some of the original wood being used in it. It was transported to be placed somewhere more likely to be seen, and also to be a memorial. Corckett's mother, Rebbecca Crockett, soon after the cabin was transformed into a museum, was also moved baside the cabin, and to its new location.</p1>
