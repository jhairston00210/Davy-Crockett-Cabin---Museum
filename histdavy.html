      <h2><b>Early Life</b></h2>
      <p>
       Davy Crockett was born on August 17, 1786 in Greene County, Tennessee. He was the fifth of nine children born to John and Rebecca Crockett. He was taught to shoot at just eight years of age, and usually accompanied his older brothers on hunting trips. However, when he was thirteen, his father insisted he go to school. Just after a few days of going, he got into a fight. Instead of going back to school and facing his punishment, he decided to run away from home. 
        He spent two years in the wilderness, his skill as a woodsman growing, and, since his father was in debt, just before he turned sixteen, he came back home to help pay off his father's credit, working for a man named John Canady. After this, he continued to work for Canady. Just afore his twentieth birthday, he married Mary Finley, fathering two sons before she died. He then married, and had two more children with, Elizabeth Patton.

        He then ran for a seat in the 20th congress, and won. After this, and changing his political stance from Jacksonian to Anti-Jacksonian, he attained a seat in the 21st congress, but lost the 22nd. He was reelected for the 23rd congress, and his political career was completed after his election for congress in 1835 ended in defeat.
        However, his various political campaign is what drew his image as a folk hero. He laundered himself as a larger-than-life sharp-shooter and woodsman. His strategy proved to be extremely effective, as he beat out his opposer in the 1833 reelection for congress.
