# Davy-Crockett-Cabin---Museum

Colors: A deep redish-brown and an off-white. We chose these to represent the wood and the white-ish material between the logs.

Font: Alegreya. We chose this font because, to us, we felt it looked a lot like a typewriter to represent the old-style feel of the cabin.

We didn't choose a specific background image. We felt it would look better without one, and to represent the simplistic design of cabins back in the day.
